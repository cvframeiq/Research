# AI-Powered Social Media Optimization Platform

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to build an AI-driven platform that analyzes visual (images/videos) and textual (captions/hashtags) content from social media to generate optimized recommendations. By combining computer vision and NLP, the system intelligently suggests hashtags, captions, and engagement strategies to help creators, businesses, and marketers improve their visibility and performance on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and X (Twitter).

## 🎯 Vision & Mission

**Vision**  
To be the go-to AI assistant for social media optimization—empowering anyone to connect meaningfully with their ideal audience.

**Mission**  
To simplify content optimization using cutting-edge AI, enabling creators to post smarter and grow faster.
